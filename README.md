# Sorting_Visualizer-
Visualization of different sorting algorithm.  Aim to visualize different sorting(ascending to descending) algorithm which are preexisting.     User will enter array of numbers, and a sorting process, available in list. (Also different constraints can be added as we proceed). To visualize all the important steps from algorithm, eg swapping and comparing etcetra. Beneficial mainly to beginners, easy for the understand different sorting algorithms available, and how different their time complexities are. (Also to give them insight to which sorting algorithm to use as per their problem. Stability and instability.
